First big step - Get GenTranscriptReadcounts.R running problems. It should have five main functions:
1) Input argument parsing (partially redone by Ted, based on Matt's earlier code)
2) Gene readcount input (partially redone by Ted, based on Matt's earlier code)
3) Reading GeneID|GeneName|TranscriptID|TranscriptName file. GGTT for short? Totally unwritten so far
4) Randonmly generating readcounts per transcript and per gene, including selection of
genes to be differentially spliced.
5) Outputting a table with the Genes, transcripts, and readcounts per condition

Second big step - taking the output from the first big step, and generating a FASTA/FASTQ file of reads
